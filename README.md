### What You Will Gain

By completing this course, you will acquire practical skills and knowledge to:

-   Audit software systems and identify security weaknesses effectively.
-   Describe identified weaknesses using MITRE's CWE<sup>TM</sup>.
-   Master methodologies, techniques, and tools used in secure code review processes.
-   Identify and address security weaknesses efficiently.
-   Conduct secure code reviews for various purposes, including enhancing code quality, improving communication, and
    educating others.

### Why Take This Course?

Many security education programs predominantly focus on exploiting vulnerabilities to showcase weaknesses. In contrast,
this course emphasizes proactive measures to secure software systems through best practices. It fills the gap in
traditional software engineering classes, which often overlook security aspects. While there's a gradual shift in
academic curriculums, this course provides you with practical knowledge and skills essential for securing software
systems in today's digital landscape.

## Course Structure

This course is structured into multiple chapters, each covering different areas and topics within software development
and security. Throughout the course, relevant code references will be provided in various programming languages such as
C#, Python, etc., although the concepts discussed are applicable to any modern-day programming language.

### Understanding Vulnerabilities

To comprehend vulnerabilities within software systems, the course will employ a root cause analysis (RCA) approach,
aided by Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE).

### Core Concepts

The course will begin by exploring fundamental concepts essential for secure software development, including:

-   Tenets of Software System Design.
-   Security Principles and the Secure Software Development Cycle.

### In-Depth Exploration

In addition to the core concepts, the course will delve into the following areas in-depth:

-   Input Security
-   Cryptography
-   Authentication & Authorization
-   Session Management
-   Error Handling
-   Logging
-   Debug Code
-   Performing Secure Code Reviews.
