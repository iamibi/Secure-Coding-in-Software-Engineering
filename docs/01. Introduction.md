## Introduction

Almost every gadget around us uses software to operate, whether it be a hearing aid or an MRI machine. Software plays a
major role in making every gadget operational and useful for its respective task. A lot of resources go into making the
software work. But not enough attention is given to the software being safe, secure, behaving correctly, effects on
other parts of the system(s). Yet, still somehow software still works.

Some of the reasons for the software being insecure

-   Poor communications (between all parties involved)
-   Commercial pressures
-   Poor system design
-   Poorly defined system requirements
-   Inaccurate estimates of required resources
-   Unmanaged Risks
-   Sloppy Development Practices
-   Use of immature technologies
-   Stakeholder politics

and many more... <sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>

### Importance of Secure Software Systems

> What are the repurcussions of an insecure software or a software failure?

While it might not seem like a big deal, software failures can have serious consequences. Here are some events that
illustrate this:

-   Injury & Loss of Life <sup>[[2]](#references)</sup>
-   Loss of financial assets <sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>
-   Loss of resources: organizational assets <sup>[[3]](#references)</sup>, the organization itself
    <sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>.
-   Loss of the software system: Denial of service
-   Loss of valuable or sensitive information
-   Loss of trust<sup>\*</sup>

And that's not all. There are also active adversaries trying to exploit vulnerabilities in software systems. These
adversaries are:

-   Well-organized, similar to small businesses
-   Well-resourced, ranging from organized crime to nation states
-   Sophisticated in their technical abilities and attack methods

> How do we identify the risks?

To identify the risks, one must look at the attacks.

### Mitigations for Insecure Software

There are ways in which a couple of reasons for software being insecure mentioned above can be mitigated.

-   _Poor System Design_
    -   Giving a thought to security during the system design.
-   _Unmanaged Risks_
    -   Identifying security risks beforehand.
-   _Sloppy Development Practices_ <br/> Certain measures can be put in place to prevent such practices, including but
    not limited to: - Software Development Guidelines - Software Lifecycle Management - Code Review Process

> What about using crypto, or anti-virus, or any other kind of Security Features?

**"Security Features"** are not the answer. Just by using Anti-virus, Crypto, Implementing your own Cryptographic
Algorithm, using Open Source Software, or any other kind of Security Software is not going to provide you with a
solution.

Furthermore, security through obsecurity is also not the answer to the problem. Like adding barriers is not going to
stop a user from finding other ways to bypass the system, thus, making it more insecure. The situation can develop a
loss of trust within the user and the software system.

There is a trade-off between Security and usability/convenience.
