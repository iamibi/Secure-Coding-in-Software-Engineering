## Design Problems

**Wicked Problem**<sup>[[1](#references)]</sup>

A problem that can be clearly defined only by solving it or solving a part of it (Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber, 1973).
You essentially solve the problem first to define the problem, then solve it again to find a solution that works.

"Design" is a wicked problem.

Some concepts of software designs can be described as

-   **_Abstraction_**: Deals with creation of conceptual entities that facilitates solving the problem by focusing on
    the essential characteristics of the entities themselves (procedural and data abstraction). Required for good
    modularization (Liskov and Guttag 2010).

-   **_Modularization_**: Decomposition of the system until fine-grained components are created.

-   **_Encapsulation_**: Principles that deals with providing access to the services of the conceptual entities
    (modules, components etc.) by exposing only essential information and hiding details on how those services are
    carried out.

-   **_Coupling_**: The manner and degree of interdependence between software modules.

-   **_Cohesion_**: The manner and degree to which the tasks performed by a single software module are related to one
    another.

-   **_Separation of Interface and Implementation_**: While encapsulation deals with exposing and hiding implementation
    details, this principle of separation goes further and allows for an interface with the implementation (separate) to
    be swapped for modified or new behavior.

-   **_Completeness_**: Measures how well design units provide required services to achieve their intent.

-   **_Sufficiency_**: Measures how well design units provide services that are sufficient to achieve their intent.

## Impact of Design Principles on Security

-   Abstraction and modularization help in being able to determine which of the modules are security relevant. If you
    donâ€™t need a module, then it is redundant and should be removed.

-   For example, having a module to deal with users and their profile management can allow for security related
    functions for a user to be implemented easily.

-   Encapsulation and Interface-Implementation Separation can be used to achieve security goals for modules as well by
    checking security related functions as part of the design. This design principle also helps in reducing the number
    of surfaces that need to be checked or secured by separating the implementation from the interface.

-   For example, exposing administrative functionality for a web based application to authenticated and authorized users
    only where the authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented independently of the Login.

-   Reducing coupling is a general software design goal and helps in securing modules because it also reduces the
    cascade of failures through the system.

-   For Example, NPM repository down: March 2016, a disgruntled developer unpublished a very popular package called
    `left-pad` due to a naming dispute that many other packages had as a dependency causing widespread
    disruption<sup>[[2](#references)]</sup>.

-   Data abstraction is a key principle that has implications on privacy and securing data flows within an application.

-   The sufficiency principle similarly has implications on minimizing the surfaces that need to be secured.

> How does software quality affect security?

There are several software quality metrics that can help assess the quality of the software and its design. High
software quality can also lead to more secure software since it helps with the maintenance of software systems during
its lifecycle.

For example, In a code base, a developer may state that a method/function is not going to be used by anyone and can stay
in the code base. Even if no other components depend on it, it is more than likely:

-   That someone will re-use the code from the component
-   That someone will make it dependent on another software module
-   That an attacker will gain access to it

Finding bugs becomes easier when software quality is maintained!
